# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the boilerplate for the Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator
=======
A Python project that calculates mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max, and sum for a 3x3 matrix. Built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification.
# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project is part of the *FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python* certification.

## 📌 Project Description
A Python function calculate() that takes a list of 9 numbers and returns a dictionary with the *mean, variance, standard deviation, min, max, and sum* for both rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.

## 📊 Example
```python
from mean_var_std import calculate

print(calculate([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]))

Output:

{
  'mean': [[3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [1.0, 4.0, 7.0], 4.0],
  'variance': [[6.0, 6.0, 6.0], [0.666..., 0.666..., 0.666...], 6.666...],
  'standard deviation': [[2.449..., 2.449..., 2.449...], [0.816..., 0.816..., 0.816...], 2.581...],
  'max': [[6, 7, 8], [2, 5, 8], 8],
  'min': [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 6], 0],
  'sum': [[9, 12, 15], [3, 12, 21], 36]
}
